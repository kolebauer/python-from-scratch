# Python Fundamentals

This repository documents my structured, ground-up review of core Python programming concepts. It is part of a broader initiative to improve fluency in Python, SQL, and C# through disciplined, fundamentals-first study and practice.

## Objectives

- Solidify understanding of essential programming concepts
- Write clean, well-structured, and maintainable Python code
- Practice problem solving and reinforce learning through repetition
- Create a public portfolio that reflects long-term skill development
